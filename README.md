To Build Urban and Rural Projections

This model can be used to disaggregate Built-up area and population projections. It is set up so that projections per functional area (created in the NetworkModel_World repo: https://github.com/ObjectVision/NetworkModel_World) are read in from a CSV, which can be found in /SourceData/Claims/Read_CSV.

Several settings are available in the '/ModelParameters', such as the study area. The model is usually run per continent, which can be chosen in the 'StudyArea_manually' parameter.
